# Leaflet.TileGeoJSON

[Leaflet](https://leafletjs.com) plugin for the layers of tiled GeoJSON. This is just like as [leaflet-tilelayer-gejson](https://github.com/glenrobertson/leaflet-tilelayer-geojson/) (but `clipTiles` and `unique` options are missing in this plugin), and works with Leaflet v1.4 (or above).
